# Hello, I'm Laura!👋
## 💠About Me
<body>
🎒I'm a student in the Graphic Information Technology program at ASU. I have an interest in graphic design and print & publishing. <br>
📚Some of my favorite things to do are read, sketch, watch sports, and travel. <br>
💻I don't have coding experience, but I'm currently working on learning HTML and CSS. <br>
🎥Outside of coding, I'm currently exploring video editing with Adobe's Premiere Pro and typography and layout design in Adobe's InDesign. <br>
💭I'm interested to learn more about coding, web design, and print & publishing.
